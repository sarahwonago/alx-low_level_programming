# C Programming Tasks

This repository contains a series of C programming tasks with specific requirements for each task. Below, you'll find details about each task along with the associated C files.

## Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing
- **Description:** This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code to print whether the number stored in `n` is positive, negative, or zero.
- **C File:** [0-positive_or_negative.c](0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)

## Task 1: The last digit
- **Description:** Similar to Task 0, this program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code to print the last digit of the number stored in `n`.
- **C File:** [1-last_digit.c](0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)

## Task 2: I sometimes suffer from insomnia.
- **Description:** Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- **C File:** [2-print_alphabet.c](0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)

## Task 3: alphABET
- **Description:** Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase.
- **C File:** [3-print_alphabets.c](0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)

## Task 4: When I was having that alphabet soup
- **Description:** Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e.'
- **C File:** [4-print_alphabt.c](0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)

## Task 5: Numbers
- **Description:** Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers in base 10.
- **C File:** [5-print_numbers.c](0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)

## Task 6: Numberz
- **Description:** Similar to Task 5, but you are not allowed to use any variable of type `char`.
- **C File:** [6-print_numberz.c](0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)

## Task 7: Smile in the mirror
- **Description:** Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.
- **C File:** [7-print_tebahpla.c](0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)

## Task 8: Hexadecimal
- **Description:** Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
- **C File:** [8-print_base16.c](0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)

## Task 9: Patience, persistence, and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success
- **Description:** Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by a comma and space.
- **C File:** [9-print_comb.c](0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)

For each task, the expected output is provided as part of the description. You can implement the code for each task in the corresponding C file, compile the program, and run it to verify that it produces the expected output.
