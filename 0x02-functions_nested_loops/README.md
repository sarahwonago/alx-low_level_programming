# C Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of C programming projects, each focusing on different aspects of programming and problem-solving. The projects are part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Project List

1. **0. _putchar**: A simple program that prints "_putchar" followed by a new line using the custom `_putchar` function.

2. **1. Alphabet Game**: A function that prints the lowercase alphabet in a single line.

3. **2. 10 x Alphabet**: A function that prints the lowercase alphabet ten times, each on a new line.

4. **3. islower**: A function that checks if a character is lowercase and returns 1 if it is, or 0 if it isn't.

5. **4. isalpha**: A function that checks if a character is alphabetic (either lowercase or uppercase) and returns 1 if it is, or 0 if it isn't.

6. **5. Sign**: A function that prints the sign of a number (+, 0, or -) and returns 1, 0, or -1 accordingly.

7. **6. Absolute Value**: A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

8. **7. Print Last Digit**: A function that prints the last digit of a number and returns it.

9. **8. Jack Bauer**: A function that prints every minute of a day (00:00 to 23:59).

10. **9. Times Table**: A function that prints the 9 times table.

11. **10. Add**: A function that adds two integers and returns the result.

12. **11. Print to 98**: A function that prints natural numbers from n to 98.

## Requirements

- All programs are written in C.
- Compilation is done using `gcc`. Example: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 <source_files> -o <output_file>`.

## Usage

Each project has its own set of instructions and usage examples. Compile the source code files and execute the resulting program to see their functionality.

Example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 _putchar.c 0-putchar.c -o 0-putchar
./0-putchar
