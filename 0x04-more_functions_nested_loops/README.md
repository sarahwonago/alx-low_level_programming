# More Functions and Nested Loops

Welcome to my repository for "More Functions and Nested Loops." In this project, you'll find a collection of C programs that perform various tasks using more functions and nested loops. Each task is described below, along with the respective main file and source code files used to complete the task.

## Task 0: isupper

File: `0-isupper.c`

This task features the implementation of a function named `_isupper`, which checks if a character is uppercase. It returns 1 if the character is uppercase and 0 otherwise. The task can be tested using the `0-main.c` file.

## Task 1: isdigit

File: `1-isdigit.c`

For this task, the function `_isdigit` is created to check if a character is a digit (0 through 9). It returns 1 if the character is a digit and 0 otherwise. You can test the function using the `1-main.c` file.

## Task 2: Collaboration is multiplication

File: `2-mul.c`

In this task, the `mul` function is developed to multiply two integers and return the result. The `2-main.c` file allows you to test the function.

## Task 3: The numbers speak for themselves

File: `3-print_numbers.c`

This task involves the creation of the `print_numbers` function, which prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a newline character. The function uses the `_putchar` function and can be tested using the `3-main.c` file.

## Task 4: I believe in numbers and signs

File: `4-print_most_numbers.c`

The `print_most_numbers` function is implemented in this task to print the numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4. The result is followed by a newline. The task allows for using the `_putchar` function and can be tested with the `4-main.c` file.

## Task 5: Numbers constitute the only universal language

File: `5-more_numbers.c`

In this task, the `more_numbers` function is designed to print the numbers from 0 to 14, ten times, followed by newlines. The `_putchar` function is used, and testing is possible with the `5-main.c` file.

## Task 6: The shortest distance between two points is a straight line

File: `6-print_line.c`

The `print_line` function is created in this task to print a straight line of a given length, ending with a newline. If the length is 0 or less, the function prints only a newline. Testing can be done using the `6-main.c` file.

## Task 7: I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe

File: `7-print_diagonal.c`

This task involves the implementation of the `print_diagonal` function, which prints a diagonal line using backslashes. The diagonal ends with a newline, and if the length is 0 or less, the function prints only a newline. Testing is possible with the `7-main.c` file.

## Task 8: You are so much sunshine in every square inch

File: `8-print_square.c`

The `print_square` function is created in this task to print a square using the '#' character. The square is followed by a newline. If the size is 0 or less, the function prints only a newline. You can test the function using the `8-main.c` file.

## Task 9: Fizz-Buzz

File: `9-fizz_buzz.c`

This task requires writing a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, following the Fizz-Buzz rules. It prints "Fizz" for multiples of three, "Buzz" for multiples of five, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are multiples of both three and five. Each number or word is separated by a space.

## Task 10: Triangles

File: `10-print_triangle.c`

In this task, the `print_triangle` function is created to print a right-angled triangle using the '#' character. The triangle's size is determined by the `size` parameter. If the size is 0 or less, the function prints only a newline. The function can be tested using the `10-main.c` file.

You are welcome to explore each task to understand how these functions are implemented and used. Happy coding!
