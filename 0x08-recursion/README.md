# Recursion in C

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the use of recursion to solve various problems. Each program corresponds to a specific task and is designed to perform a specific operation using recursive techniques.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 0: She locked away a secret...

- **0-puts_recursion.c**: This file contains the C function `_puts_recursion` that prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion. It takes a character pointer (string) as its argument.


### Task 1: Why is it so important to dream?

- **1-print_rev_recursion.c**: This file includes the C function `_print_rev_recursion` that prints a string in reverse using recursion. It takes a character pointer (string) as its argument.


### Task 2: Dreams feel real while we're in them...

- **2-strlen_recursion.c**: In this file, the C function `_strlen_recursion` is implemented. It returns the length of a string (number of characters) using recursion. It takes a character pointer (string) as its argument.



### Task 3: You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling

- **3-factorial.c**: This file contains the C function `factorial`, which calculates and returns the factorial of a given number using recursion. If the input is less than 0, the function returns -1. The factorial of 0 is considered 1.


### Task 4: Once an idea has taken hold of the brain...

- **4-pow_recursion.c**: In this file, the C function `_pow_recursion` is implemented. It calculates and returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` using recursion. If `y` is less than 0, the function returns -1.


### Task 5: Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer

- **5-sqrt_recursion.c**: For this task, the C function `_sqrt_recursion` is created. It calculates and returns the natural square root of a number using recursion. If the input does not have a natural square root, the function returns -1.


### Task 6: Inception. Is it possible?

- **6-is_prime_number.c**: In this file, the C function `is_prime_number` is defined. It checks if a given integer is a prime number and returns 1 if it's prime, or 0 if it's not prime. The function uses recursion for this task. If the input is less than or equal to 1, it returns 0.
