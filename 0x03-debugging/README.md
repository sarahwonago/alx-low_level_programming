# Debugging Tasks

This repository contains several tasks related to debugging C programs. Below, you'll find a brief explanation of each task and the files associated with them.

## Task 0: Multiple mains

File: `0-main.c`, `main.h`

This task requires to create a new test file, `0-main.c`, to test the function `positive_or_negative()`. The test case checks if the function produces the correct output for the case where the input is 0.

## Task 1: Like, comment, subscribe

File: `1-main.c`

In this task, you are provided with a main file that contains a code segment leading to an infinite loop. Your goal is to comment out the code that causes the infinite loop. The line count should not change, and you should only comment out existing code.

## Task 2: 0 > 972?

Files: `2-main.c`, `2-largest_number.c`, `main.h`

The program in `2-main.c` is supposed to print the largest of three integers, but it currently produces an incorrect result. The task is to fix the `2-largest_number.c` code so that it correctly identifies and prints the largest number. There is no line count restriction for this task.

## Task 3: Leap year

Files: `3-main_a.c`, `3-convert_day.c`, `3-print_remaining_days.c`, `main.h`

The program in `3-main_a.c` converts a date to the day of the year, considering leap years. However, it doesn't handle leap years correctly for some dates. The task is to fix the `3-print_remaining_days.c` code so that it correctly handles all dates and leap years. There is no line count restriction for this task.

Note: All test cases in these tasks are assumed to have valid months, days, and months/days combinations, but not all year/month/day combinations are valid.
